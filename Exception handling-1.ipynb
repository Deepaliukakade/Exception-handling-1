    "'''Exceptions in Python\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of instructions.\n",
    "It's an error that happens at runtime, often due to unforeseen circumstances, such as division by zero, out-of-range values, or file-not-found errors.\n",
    "Exceptions vs. Syntax Errors\n",
    "Here's the key difference:\n",
    "Syntax Errors: These occur when there's a problem with the code's syntax, such as missing or mismatched brackets, \n",
    "incorrect indentation, or typos in keywords. Syntax errors prevent the code from running altogether.\n",
    "Exceptions: These occur during runtime, when the code is executed. Exceptions can be handled and recovered from, \n",
    "whereas syntax errors need to be fixed before the code can run.'''\n",
